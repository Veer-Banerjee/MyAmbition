        <h2>Veer</h2>

        <p>Hey there! My name is Veer. I am a student at ProGrad Junior. 
             My fav color is blue and I like dogs (pet-wise). 
            Otherwise I feel Lions are the coolest animals. I am in grade 11. 
            I live in Banagalore, India.

        <p>I want to become a Software Developer because I have always been curious about new technologies. 
            How the applications run, games are created. Now that I have started to learn about coding I find it interesting and very simple to do. 
            I look forward to creating many applications and games.</p>
